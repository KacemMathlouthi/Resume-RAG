# **Resume-Based Chatbot with Gradio**

A chatbot application that leverages **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** to answer questions about an individual's professional experience. The chatbot is designed to retrieve relevant information from a resume and generate intelligent responses using state-of-the-art language models.

---

## **Features**
- **Resume-based Question Answering:** Ask questions about the professional background of Kacem Mathlouthi.
- **Semantic Search:** Uses embeddings to retrieve the most relevant sections of the resume.
- **Gradio Interface:** A user-friendly interface for interacting with the chatbot.
- **Modular Design:** Cleanly organized for future scalability.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Core programming language for the project.
- **Gradio**: For building the chatbot interface.
- **LangChain**: To handle embeddings and retrieval-augmented search.
- **Chroma**: For vector-based semantic search.
- **Groq**: For generating responses using pre-trained language models.
- **sentence-transformers**: For embedding generation.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/resume-chatbot.git
cd resume-chatbot
```

### **2. Create a Virtual Environment**
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**
Install all required libraries from `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **4. Add the Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

### **5. Run the Application**
Launch the Gradio interface:
```bash
python app.py
```
The application will run locally, and you can access it in your browser at [http://127.0.0.1:7860](http://127.0.0.1:7860).

---

## **Usage**
1. **Ask Questions:** Use the chatbot interface to ask specific questions about the resume. For example:
   - *"What are Kacem Mathlouthi's main skills?"*
   - *"Tell me about his previous work experience."*
2. **Clear Chat:** Use the clear button to reset the chat.

---

## **Examples**

### Example Input:
**User:** "What programming languages does Kacem know?"

**Bot:** "Kacem is proficient in Python, Java, and C++."

---

## **Testing**
To run unit tests:
1. Install `pytest` (already included in `requirements.txt`).
2. Run tests from the `tests` directory:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Support for additional data formats like PDFs or DOCX files.
- Improved error handling and logging.
- Cloud hosting for public access.
